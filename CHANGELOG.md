## [1.2.0] - 2026-02-19

### Security
- **SSRF prevention**: Added private IP blocking to `fetch_page.py` and `analyze_visual.py`
- **Path traversal prevention**: Added output path sanitization to `capture_screenshot.py` and file validation to `parse_html.py`
- **Install hardening**: Removed `--break-system-packages`, switched to venv-based pip install
- **requirements.txt**: Persisted to the installed skill directory for user retry

### Fixed
- **YAML frontmatter parsing**: Removed HTML comments before `---` delimiter in 8 files (skills: seo-content, seo-images, seo-programmatic, seo-schema, seo-technical; agents: seo-content, seo-performance, seo-technical). Thanks @kylewhirl for identifying this in the codex-seo fork.
- **Windows installer**: Merged @kfrancis improvements — `python -m pip`, `py -3` launcher fallback, requirements.txt persistence, non-fatal subagent copy, better error diagnostics (PR #6)
- **requirements.txt missing after install**: Now copied to skill directory so users can retry (#1)

### Changed
- Python dependencies now installed in a venv under the installed skill path with `--user` fallback (#2)
- Playwright marked as explicitly optional in install output
- Windows installer uses `Resolve-Python` helper for robust Python detection (#5)
