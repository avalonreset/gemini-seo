# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are provided for the current `main` branch.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not post detailed vulnerability reports in public issues.

Preferred reporting paths:

1. Use GitHub private vulnerability reporting for this repository (if available).
2. If private reporting is unavailable, open a public issue titled `Security Contact Request` without exploit details, and include only:
   - affected file/path
   - high-level impact
   - how to contact you

The maintainer will follow up with a private channel for full details.

## Disclosure Expectations

- Give maintainers reasonable time to investigate and patch before public disclosure.
- Include clear reproduction steps and scope where possible.
- Reporters acting in good faith will be acknowledged.
