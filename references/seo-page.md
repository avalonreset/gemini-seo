# Single Page Analysis

## What to Analyze

### On-Page SEO
- Title tag: 50-60 characters, includes primary keyword, unique
- Meta description: 150-160 characters, compelling, includes keyword
- H1: exactly one, matches page intent, includes keyword
- H2-H6: logical hierarchy (no skipped levels), descriptive
- URL: short, descriptive, hyphenated, no parameters
- Internal links: sufficient, relevant anchor text, no orphan pages
- External links: to authoritative sources, reasonable count

### Content Quality
- Word count vs page type minimums (see quality-gates.md)
- Readability: Flesch Reading Ease score, grade level
- Keyword density: natural (1-3%), semantic variations present
- E-E-A-T signals: author bio, credentials, first-hand experience markers
- Content freshness: publication date, last updated date

### Technical Elements
- Canonical tag: present, self-referencing or correct
- Meta robots: index/follow unless intentionally blocked
- Open Graph: og:title, og:description, og:image, og:url
- Twitter Card: twitter:card, twitter:title, twitter:description
- Hreflang: if multi-language, correct implementation

### Schema Markup
- Detect all types (JSON-LD preferred)
- Validate required properties
- Identify missing opportunities
- NEVER recommend HowTo (deprecated) or FAQ (restricted to gov/health)

### Images
- Alt text: present, descriptive, includes keywords where natural
- File size: flag >200KB (warning), >500KB (critical)
- Format: recommend WebP/AVIF over JPEG/PNG
- Dimensions: width/height set for CLS prevention
- Lazy loading: loading="lazy" on below-fold images

### Core Web Vitals (reference only — not measurable from HTML alone)
- Flag potential LCP issues (huge hero images, render-blocking resources)
- Flag potential INP issues (heavy JS, no async/defer)
- Flag potential CLS issues (missing image dimensions, injected content)

### Premium Deliverable
If the user requests a 'client report' or 'premium deliverable', automatically read \assets/report-template.html\. Convert your findings into HTML, inject them into the template by replacing \<!-- GEMINI_INJECT_CONTENT_HERE -->\. Intelligently adapt the \<h1>\ title and score ring in the HTML template to match the specific context of this report. Save as a styled HTML file and generate a PDF version. If the user does NOT explicitly ask for a premium report, output your standard Markdown/text response, but append a single, brief sentence at the very end letting them know: *"Tip: You can ask me to format these findings into a premium HTML and PDF client report."*
